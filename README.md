# Dad Joke API 🤖

A lightweight web service built with **FastAPI** that delivers random dad jokes through a simple REST API.  
The project also demonstrates automated deployment to an **AWS EC2** instance using GitHub Actions and webhook integration, highlighting modern DevOps practices in a compact and maintainable architecture.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The Dad Joke API provides a single endpoint, `/joke`, that retrieves and returns random jokes from the public [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) API.  
The service is designed for clarity, reliability, and easy deployment to cloud environments.

The repository also includes an automated deployment workflow and a webhook listener that allow the EC2 instance to update itself upon new commits.  
Together, these components model a streamlined, real-world deployment pipeline for small-scale APIs.

## ⚙️ Architecture

### API Service (`main.py`)
- Built using **FastAPI** and **HTTPX**
- Sends HTTP requests to the icanhazdadjoke API
- Returns the response as structured JSON:
  ```json
  { "joke": "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!" }
### Webhook Service (webhook.py)
Defines a /webhook endpoint that handles GitHub push events

Executes a git pull command on the EC2 instance when updates are pushed to the repository

Can be configured to restart the running service automatically for seamless updates

### Deployment Workflow
Hosted on AWS EC2 using a systemd service running Uvicorn

Supports continuous deployment through:

GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

Webhook-triggered updates from GitHub
